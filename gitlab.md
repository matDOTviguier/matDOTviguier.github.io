# Gitlab EE
I was an _aficionado_ of GitLab Community Edition (CE) as an earyly adopter of __git__. When I moved, for real, from an advanced user to a Profesionnal DevOps Engineer & Cloud Architect & Agile Coach, and found that GitLab Enterprise Edition (EE) could be used for free. Then I definetly drop off GitHub.
Once you plug your __own infrastructure__ with __your own__ GitLab EE flavor, you, really, can dive deep inside DevOps.
